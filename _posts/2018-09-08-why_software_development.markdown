Because knowledge is power, so why not? HA. Here's a general list on why I am choosing to do it: 
1. In demand: Probably a very popular reason amongst "bootcampers". More and more software is being deployed and being used on a regular basis around the globe, and demand is still outpacing supply. Positioning myself competitively in the job market allows me to open opportunities for career growth. Which leads to my next point...
2. Future proof: Because of changing and rapidly evolving "technology dependance", many jobs are quickly disappearing and very often being replaced by computers and software. All those computers and softwares need to be developed and maintained by well versed software engineers  - so the opportunities are vast and continue growing.  
3. Creative: It's fascinating how progamming can feel like solving a puzzle and building complex puzzles to create solutions to problems. And one of the most satisfying aspects is seeing my code deployed and executed by users, and how it improves their lives in some way. 
4. Collaborative: Working together with others is one of my favorites. Brainstorming and coming up with effective and efficient programming solutions is satisfying because "team work makes the dream work". 

So if I were to answer the question above in a single sentence it would in fact be "Duh, because why not". It's fun, it stimulates your brain in so many ways, it introduces you to new fields and pushes you to work with many people... AND on top of all that, it's highly valued and will continue to be.
