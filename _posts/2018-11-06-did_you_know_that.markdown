Once with (Frank) Sinatra and the second with the Ruby web framework, Sinatra! <3  

[One of my Frank Sinatra favorites](https://youtu.be/EUrUfJW1JGk)

For those of you not yet familiar with the latter, Sinatra is a DSL written in Ruby used to create web applications and here are reasons as to why I love it: 

1. Simplicity: you can create a fully functional web app using Sinatra in just one file. There are no complicated set up procedures, configuration, or generators to worry about: You can just open up a text editor and start hacking away. Routes are simple to implement and have a great syntax that uses all of the http verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE), making it easy to create RESTful applications. Simplified, Sinatra lets you write simple yet elegant code that produces amazing results.

2. Flexibility: Sinatra can be used to build anything from the smallest of microsites to a full-scale web application. It’s the perfect choice for API implementations, widgets, Facebook apps as well as many others. I often use it to just try out new ideas or prototype a website quickly. Sinatra is built on top of Rack, making it easy to extend using Ruby Gems and its own extension API. This opens up a world of possibilities for extending your application and avoids you having to reinvent the wheel.

3. Unbiased: You don’t have to use the MVC paradigm and you’re not tied to any particular ORM (e.g. Active Record), JavaScript framework (e.g. JQuery). This puts you, the developer, back in the driving seat, giving you full control over how to best implement your application. 

```
 $> gem install sinatra
``` 
-- the start of a new love.
