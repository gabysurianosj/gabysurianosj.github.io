I am a big fan of random fun facts. As I work through the bootcamp's curriculum, my mind constantly wanders off to trying to figure out the why behind some things. Here are a few of the things I've learned: 

1. Sinatra - the Ruby web framework is named after the famous artist Frank Sinatra - hence, the hat logo. And used by major tech companies like Apple, Github, LinkedIn, in addition to lots more.

2. Java Script vs. Java - the only similarity these have is the name. Rumor has it that the JS developers stole the first four letters for marketing purposes, others argue that didn't happen. Whatever the story really is, make sure you understand the clear differences between these two:
* Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.
* Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.
* Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
* They require different plug-ins.

3. Ruby - the name was chosen to suggest "a jewel of a language". And if by jewel they were aiming for "easy to read and write", I would have to agree with that.
