The 'UNESCO World Heritage Finder' was created to help you find any world heritage site listed in [UNESCO's website](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). You can pick which site you are interested in learning more about - maybe it will lead to your next travel destination!

With over 1,000 sites listed, it is hard to keep track and remember all the info about these sites so we hope this app facilitates the process.
