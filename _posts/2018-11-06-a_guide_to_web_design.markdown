As I approach the end of the bootcamp, I cannot wait to start coding my own web apps. The following is a mix of items I would consider critical before starting to program my first ever web application. Wish me luck! 

1. Create a menu structure:

Also known as IA (information architecture) - creating a menu structure is all about the organization of information in a clear and logical way. The purpose is to help users to navigate a complex set of information. One way to do start doing this is by using the method 'card sorting', which is usually used by to test for whether it satisfies the user's mental model.  

2. Define links and navigation options: 
* Navigation is the backbone of usability and for this reason is should follow these principles: simplicity, clarity, and consistency
* Assign priority levels to navigation options (highest to common user tasks)
* Clarity between internal and external links 
* Changing color of visited links

3. Define content strategy: 
* The most important thing is to focus the design on page objectives 
* Prevent information overload 
* Avoid industry-specific terms, you never know who is visiting your website 
* Being concise vs. being wordy. Always best to minimize long content sections

4. Create mockups to clarify visual hierarchy: 
* A proper visual hierarchy makes it easy to scan the page 
* Prioritize important elements on the page 

5. Use of appropriate and quality media:
* Avoid generic photos of people 
* Use high quality media with no distortion 
* Set audio off by default for videos 

6. Identify and create relevant forms: 
* Most important is to create a logical communication between both parties 
* Keep the form concise 
* Group related field together
